HOWTO apply changes in development repository to 910 repository

1. create a git patch file (in dev):

git format-patch <from-revision> --stdout > delivery.patch

2. switch to a release repo

cd 910-...

3. create a temporary local Git branch

git branch tmp
git checkout tmp

4. apply the patch onto tmp branch (creates a series of commits)

git am < delivery.patch

NOTE: Whenever you encounter problem applying patch, this is the recommended approach to fix:
 - put the source tree in START state for those files whose patch cannot be applied (use original repo)
 - use patch -p0 < .git/rebase-apply/patch
 - do git add
 - do git am --continue

 Otherwise you are loosing changes!
 Make sure there are no .orig files!

5. switch to master branch

git checkout master

6. merge the tmp branch into master without really merging it (apply squashed commits instead)

git merge --squash tmp



DO NOT FORGET

set the: APP_VERSION_NAME=0.D4.3

in gradle.properties



HOWTO build APK

# ./gradlew assembleRelease

The output can then be found at:

./app/build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk

Copy the APK to binaries/Dx/ArgoManager-Dx.apk
The unsigned APK is useless (it cannot be installed without certificate).
